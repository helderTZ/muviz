# MUVIZ - Music Visualizer

A music visualizer in C using Raylib. Plays music files while animating their frequencies.

(Code along) Original idea and code: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpM-Dvs8t0Vak1rrE2NJn8XYEJ5M7-BqT, implementation follows closely but not completely.

TODO:
- Implement hot reloading
- Implementation in Zig (currently trouble with build system not stable)
- Implementation in Rust (currently not all bindings are available and build system giving some trouble when trying to implement them)
